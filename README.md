# Linear-Regression-with-Tensorflow

Version of Tensorflow : '2.4.1'
Linear model is used to find the relationship between dependent variable and the independent variable
In this code ,
linear_model is an operational node which calculates the hypothesis for the linear regression model(y=mx+c) here it is linear_model=W*X+b
Cost per gradient descent is calculated as mean squared error
Optimizer node is used to implement Gradient Descent Algorithm
